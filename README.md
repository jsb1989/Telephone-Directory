# Telephone-Directory
This directory keeps track of contacts for the user.
It is also my first attempt at creating a GUI using Java.
Functions it has: 
- Adding contacts (First & Last name, Phone Number, Email, and work or school)
- Delete Contact (As of now it will the entire delete contact)
- Search (User can search using any of the categories)
- Sort and display (Can use any category to sort the database)
